# Chart-corpus findings: status ledger

Last reconciled 2026-07-17, after the in-progress completion round
(F31/F51/F68/F71/F93 same-map/NATS member kinds; see the work log's
"In-progress completion round"). One classification per finding. Where a finding has
both a completed bounded part and a remainder, the remainder is what is
classified here; the completed part is listed under Completed with a
"(bounded)" marker. Per-finding evidence and fix history live in the dated
sections of the historical work log in `chart-corpus-expansion.md`.

## Completed

Fixed on the current tree and pinned by tests (corpus fixtures,
`chart_reaudit` cases, or focused gen/IR reproducers):

- F1 dotted values keys split into fabricated nested paths

- F17 stringification transfer functions rejecting values Helm accepts

- F56 generic fragment fallback vs structural placement (jaeger,
  CloudNativePG, airflow, CoreDNS ranged items)
- F57 broad fragment alternatives bypassing member/range contracts
- F58 integer rangeability vs range-variable arity (jenkins hasKey/member
  slot degradation)
- F59 range-body requirements reaching iterable lanes (direct ranged
  members; velero schedules via `additionalProperties`)
- F60 `eq`/`ne` operand domains incl. missing/null tolerance
- F61 strict collection-call signatures for every audited function
  (uncatalogued long tail abstains by design — see Rejected)
- F62 opening empty declared containers erasing the container type
- F63 chained member reads requiring intermediate members (incl.
  header-member ordering)

  the exact semver comparator-to-regex arm (airflow base_url)
- F65 ordered helper mutation in accepted input domains
- F66 runtime consumer domains scoped by call execution
- F67 integer rangeability across JSON roundtrips
- F69 range/member projections escaping live outer guards
- F70 `index` access preconditions — literal indices and literal split
  positions (bounded; dynamic cross-path remainder is Rejected)
- F73 statically selected file-backed template programs (`.Files.Get`
  programs, BasePath partials)
- F74 strict parser lexical domains — semver/duration/URL catalog,
  conditional literal reassignment, lexical escape tokens (bounded; the
  printf-derived datadog tag is Rejected)
- F75 shape erasure through `first`/`last`/`initial`/`rest`/`compact` and
  audited nested member paths (bounded; dynamic `slice`/opaque identities
  are Rejected)
- F76 YAML scalar lexical safety: plain-token exclusions with class-aware
  allowances, numeric-grammar exclusions, double/single-quoted content,
  flow style, mapping keys, completed-token contracts, composite-in-quotes
  recursive serialization preimage (F76.2), empty-scalar defaults under
  member projection
- F77 `and`/`or` selected-operand values
- F78 value-selecting functions keeping candidate-selection predicates
- F79 `break`/`continue` suppressing later-iteration contracts
- F80 ordered `merge`/`mergeOverwrite` layers with per-key shadowing arms
  (velero securityContext)
- F81 Sprig arithmetic coercion boundary
- F82 chart-authored `values.yaml` programs executed by `tpl`
- F84 split-segment provider preimage for integer slots (bounded; general
  numeric enum/range projection is Rejected)
- F86 strict Boolean call signatures incl. architecture partitions and
  `IntGt` sound subsets
- F87 builtin signatures constraining nested collection elements
- F88 derived literal-membership and `typeOf`→`regexMatch` dispatch guards
- F89 statically constructed finite `tpl` programs

- F91 parenthesized nil-safe selectors and receiver members
- F92 synthetic helper-dict field provenance identities
- F94 reflect `invalid` kind as presence/nullability predicate
- F96 header-condition string contracts (null override coalesces to
  absence — renamed accordingly)
- F97 niladic methods on typed Helm objects
- F98 provider-required output fields requiring source leaves
- F99 finite literal `fromYaml` path programs (traversal interpreter)
- F100 post-`tpl` regex requirements on raw template programs
- F101 provider availability as a committed deterministic test input
  (`testdata/provider-bundle/`, cold/warm equivalence)
- F102 bitnami-redis locked `common` dependency vendored plus
  corpus-integrity gate
- F103 test compositors scrubbing nulls only along map chains
- F104 `$tplYaml` program-wrapper alternatives at value nodes (bounded;
  the extraResources member-kind case is tracked under In progress)

- F31 scalar-domain fail implications: `len` bounds via the pattern
  subset, `int`-coerced inequality pairs via the raw-integer subset,
  negated literal membership via the exact NotEq conjunction, and the
  semver-minimum terminal through the comparator pattern subset (cilium
  name/kvstoreMode/maxConnectedClusters, airflow minimum version; the
  jenkins variable-bound coercion validator remains In progress)
- F51 existential range sentinels: branch joins stamp arm conditions onto
  changed truthiness reductions (bounded), the joined
  `Range ∧ member-Eq` flag lowers as `ConditionalGuard::
  ContainsMemberEquals` (`contains` on the array lane, the double-negated
  member quantifier on the object lane), and terminal clauses admit
  approximate conjuncts through their sound subsets (airflow's celery
  broker sentinel)
- F68 range-key slot domains: a raw range key rendered at a provider slot
  rides a marked splice (`range_key`) whose collection gains a
  keys-must-be-strings arm when the slot is string-only — non-empty lists
  excluded, maps and empty lists open (minio `environment`, and the
  `extraObjects`-family arms across the corpus)
- F71 optional-dependency helper availability: unconditional include
  closures over define bodies plus define ownership by chart directory
  yield terminal clauses for the inactive states of an optional
  dependency that solely owns a live helper (bitnami-postgresql's
  `tags.bitnami-common`, scoped by the including chart's own activation —
  the airflow postgresql counter-pin)
- F93 same-map member identity through `pluck`: `keys m` keeps the map
  identity (`KeysList`), `sortAlpha` preserves it, `pluck . $dict |
  first` over the ranged key is a member projection, `printf "%T"` joins
  the type-descriptor family, and member-local type partitions lower to
  member overlays carrying the provider projection (pinned at gen level;
  the signoz corpus chart itself abstains — see Rejected)
- NATS `extraResources` member kinds: a ranged member spliced as a whole
  document at column zero must be an object when present and non-null
  (Helm decodes every manifest as a mapping); wrapper items are objects
  and stay open

## In progress

Implementable remainders. Each entry lists the current reproducer evidence
and the intended structural fix.

- **F31 remainder — variable-bound coercion validators.** Jenkins binds
  `$replicas := int (default 1 .Values.controller.replicas)` and fails
  outside 0/1; the sound-subset recognizers only see inline cast
  expressions, so the bound form abstains. Needs retained binding
  expressions (or reduction-carried cast provenance) for locals so the
  raw-integer subset can fire through the variable.
- **F83/F85 — inline-local kind partition provider projection.** Airflow's
  scheduler selects its workload kind through an inline local
  (`kind: {{ if $stateful }}StatefulSet{{ else }}Deployment{{ end }}`);
  numeric `scheduler.strategy` is accepted in the live Deployment arm
  though the provider rejects `/spec/strategy`, and `updateStrategy`
  mirrors it in the StatefulSet arm. The kind×apiVersion×guard machinery
  works for values-selected kinds (synthetic matrix pin); the inline form
  needs predicate-qualified kind branches on `ResourceRef` (mirroring
  `api_version_branches`) threaded from the resource detector through the
  generator's kind partitioning, so rows guarded by the selecting
  predicate resolve their kind.

## Rejected (invalid or won't fix by design)

Closed without (further) implementation. Reopening any of these needs new
evidence or a model extension, not more of the same analysis.

- **F12 — strict-mode policy adjudications.** Dead/misplaced CI keys
  (datadog, grafana typo) stay rejected by design; the root `global`
  namespace stays open by policy; dynamic-`tpl`-only key introductions
  remain a documented strict-mode limitation.
- **F38/F72/F95 — input-channel numeric kinds.** One Draft-07 instance
  cannot accept Helm's `--set` int64 channel while rejecting the
  values-file float64 channel for the same JSON number (istiod
  `certSigners`, CoreDNS zero/negative `servers`). The analyzer emits the
  explicit `InputChannelNumericRangeAmbiguity` diagnostic instead of
  presenting a channel-dependent answer as exact. The structural parts
  (rangeability, arity, zero-iteration domains) are Completed.
- **F70 remainder — dynamic cross-path index cardinality.** A
  `length(source) > index` relation where the index comes from another
  path or a loop is relational and not expressible as an ordinary Draft-07
  property schema; literal cases are Completed.
- **F75 remainder — dynamic collection projections.** Dynamic `slice`
  bounds and identities hidden behind opaque locals/helpers intentionally
  abstain.
- **F61 remainder — uncatalogued call long tail.** Unknown Sprig/Helm
  functions abstain; treating every unknown call as strict (or copying
  output types onto operands) would recreate the false-rejection classes
  this plan removed. Audited functions get catalogued as audits surface
  them.
- **F74 remainder — datadog printf-composed agent tag.**
  `get-agent-version` composes derived text through `printf`; no sound
  bounded preimage exists, so the raw tag abstains (false ACCEPT, not a
  false rejection).
- **F84 remainder — general substring preimages.** Projecting an arbitrary
  provider numeric enum/range onto the nth substring of a raw string is
  not faithfully encodable as a Draft-07 regex once signs, bases, and
  coercion are involved; the integer-slot subset is Completed.
- **F93 remainder — cross-map dynamic key correlation.** Draft-07 cannot
  correlate one dynamic property name across two independent maps; only
  the same-map projection (In progress above) is representable.
- **SigNoz `additionalEnvs` member constraints — relational member set.**
  The chart's `renderAdditionalEnv` gates every render on a case-folding
  dedup accumulator: a member can be SHADOWED by an earlier
  case-colliding key and never render, so a blanket per-member EnvVar
  constraint would falsely reject `{audit: {value: 7}, AUDIT: …}`. The
  schema soundly keeps the members open
  (`signoz_additional_env_members_stay_open_under_dedup_shadowing` pins
  the shadowed-member acceptance); the same-map projection MACHINERY is
  Completed and gen-pinned. A future bounded increment could constrain
  singleton maps (`maxProperties: 1` ⇒ the first iteration provably
  renders).
- **Adjudicated-wrong audit claims.** AWS LBC `nameOverride: "null"`:
  rendering yields a null label value that the strict v1.35.0 schemas
  reject on every resource, so the plain-token exclusion is correct.
  SigNoz zookeeper printf pin: helm aborts on a non-string
  `clickhouse.zookeeper.nameOverride` inside Sprig `contains`, so the
  operand-abstention pin was wrong and was replaced by the branch-scope
  pin.
