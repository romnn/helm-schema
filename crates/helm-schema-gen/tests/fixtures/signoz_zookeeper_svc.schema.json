(Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, \"Cluster\", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get \"Cluster\" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.",
